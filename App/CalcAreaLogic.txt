This code defines a function to calculate the real-world area (in cm²) of a segmented region (such as a wound) in an image, 
using a reference chessboard grid for scale. 

1) It reads the input image (The wound image with a reference placed next to it) and converts it to grayscale.
2) It detects a 5x5 chessboard pattern in the image to use as a reference for real-world measurements.
3) It calculates the mean distance between adjacent chessboard corners to estimate the size of one square in pixels.
4) It computes the area of one square in pixels (mean distance squared).
5) It counts the number of nonzero pixels in the predicted mask (the segmented region).
6) It divides the mask pixel count by the area of one square to estimate the real-world area in cm².
7) If the chessboard is not found, it raises an error.
