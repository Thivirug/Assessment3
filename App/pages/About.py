            Our application uses deep learning to segment foot ulcers from clinical images. This allows medical professionals to quickly and accurately assess the size and severity of wounds.  
           
            The goal is to provide an easy-to-use, real-time tool that automates wound segmentation and helps calculate surface area using a reference marker.

        The dataset used is from the Foot Ulcer Segmentation Challenge:
        - 810 training images + masks  
        - 200 validation images + masks  
        - 200 testing images (no masks)  

        We performed data augmentation with Albumentations, increasing the dataset to 4860 training samples. Each image is paired with a binary mask used for segmentation.
